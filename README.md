# Sonarr Connect

The extension gives the ability to show Sonarr activities like: History, Wanted/Missing, upcoming shows and an overview of all your shows with status straight in Google Chrome. It also shows a badge in your chrome browser which shows how many episodes are wanted/missing. So you know when to take action without checking Sonarr very often.

Setup the extention: <br />
1. Install via chrome storage <br />
2. Open the config page(right click on sonarr icon).  <br />
--- its best to copy and past your URL and APIkey  <br />
3. Open the extension. <br />
